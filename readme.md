<h1> Epicodus Week 2 assessment </h1>

<p> 
	In this assesment we are tasked with building a pizza shop's order form. 

	I decided to use 3 objects for the order form.  A pizza object, naturally.  A toppings object to keep track of the price adjustment for the pizza and a name to help communicate the order to the pizza shop.

	I brought both of these together with an order object.  The total order cost will increase when you add pizzas to it.  I didn't create a "remove pizza" method, but that would be the natural next step for this object.

Challenges faced:
<ul>
	<li>This project felt quite a bit easier than last week.  I feel much more comfortable with javascript as well as objected oriented programming.  The assignments this week were perfect for preparing for this assessment</li>
	<li>jQuery was my main struggle throughout the week.  I feel like I am finally starting to harness control of it and getting it to do what I want it to do without much trouble.  </li>
</ul>
